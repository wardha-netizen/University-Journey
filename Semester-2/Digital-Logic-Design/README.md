# Room Security and Automation 
**Course:** Digital Logic Design (Semester 2)

A comprehensive smart room system designed and simulated in **Multisim**. This project integrates binary password security, motion-based alarms, and automated appliance control.

##  Project Features
* **Access Control:** 5-bit binary digital lock with XNOR logic.
* **Security Alarm:** Automated siren triggered after 3 failed attempts (via JK Flip-Flops).
* **Automation:** Motion-sensing lights and temperature-regulated ventilation.

##  Project Package
* **[DLDProject-Report.pdf](./DLDProject-Report.pdf):** Detailed technical report, objectives, and logic diagrams.
* **[DLD-Simulation-Files.zip](./DLD-Simulation-Files.zip):** Complete Multisim (.ms14) circuit files and simulation data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
* **Software:** Multisim
* **Logic:** Combinational (XNOR, AND, OR) & Sequential (JK Flip-Flops)
